2.4.2

JCP is the main program used for communication with the Skunkboard.

Fair warning: I am not updating this and people are generally not offering merge requests back, so you might want to wander the list of forks to see latest.

This also includes BIOS revisions 3.0.2 (for rev 2 and 3 boards) and 1.2.4 (for rev 1 boards) built in. The dist folder includes a Windows binary, all others will need to build from source.

It requires LibUSB 0.1 to be available. For Windows, the .lib and header file are provided. 
For Linux or OSX, you must get these files yourself and set up LibUSB on your system correctly.

The jcp.vcproj and libusb.lib files are used for people building under Windows.
The Makefile is used for people building under Linux or OSX.

For getting the libUSB drivers on modern Windows operating systems, this tool has been useful:

JCP and all original SKUNKBOARD properties (source, binary, design, etc) are released to the PUBLIC DOMAIN. No support is available, no warranty is possible, and you can do whatever you like with it, except claim ownership. :)
